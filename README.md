# Health-Expenditure-Prediction-using-Regression-Techniques

## Overview

This project aims to predict the Health Expenditure Per Capita based on the health data sourced from kaggle. 

## Dataset

The Health_Full_Data csv dataset, sourced from Kaggle, includes various data such as Country, Region and Health Expenditure as % of GDP.

## Requirements

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- Regression Algorithms
- RandomForestRegressor
- pickle

## Prediction Process

1. Start with downloading the Health_Full_Data dataset from the repository
2. Install the required libraries in Jupyter Notebook
3. Check for any inconsistencies, missing or null values and outliers in the data and fix them
4. Explore the data, uncover patterns and identify potential issues
6. Train the model to predict the Health Expenditure Per Capita
7. Evaluate model performance using MSE, MAE and R2 score.
8. Fit the best-performing model and save it as pickle file
